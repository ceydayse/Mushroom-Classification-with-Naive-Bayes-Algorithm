# Mushroom-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
In this project, it is aimed to make classification using Naive-Bayes algorithm with Mushroom Data Set. 
The Naive-Bayes algorithm is purely probabilistic, meaning Bayesian learning refers to problem solving involving machine learning with a probabilistic approach. In this project, we will present the results we obtained with this algorithm.
