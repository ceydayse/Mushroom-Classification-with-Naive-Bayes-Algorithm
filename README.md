# Mushroom-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
In this project, it is aimed to make classification using Naive-Bayes algorithm with Mushroom Data Set. 

The Naive-Bayes algorithm is purely probabilistic, meaning Bayesian learning refers to problem solving involving machine learning with a probabilistic approach. In this project, we will present the results we obtained with this algorithm.

The materials we used in our project are given below:
1) Data set containing information such as cap-shape, cap-color, habitat of mushrooms
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification 
2) Data analysis and visualization software such as Python language, Pycharm IDE, Rapidminer
3) Libraries and packages to implement the Naive Bayes algorithm
